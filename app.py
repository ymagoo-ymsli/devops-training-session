"""
An application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data using a Flask server.
Your application should allow you to add a product, retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. 
All these operations will be achieved through the REST API endpoints in your Flask server.

from flask import Flask # import the Flask class from the flask module
from flask import request # import the request class from the flask module for handling and making HTTP requests
from flask import jsonify # import the jsonify class from the flask module for converting a Python dictionary or list into JSON format
from flask_cors import CORS # import the CORS class from the flask_cors module, this allows cross origin resource sharing which allows for use of your api by other domains
# CORS is a Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible. It is a way to relax the same-origin policy, which is a set of restrictions imposed by browsers to prevent interactions between resources from different origins.
# you can configure CORS options to specify allowed origins, headers, and other settings according to your requirements.


app = Flask(__name__) # creates an instance of the Flask class called "app", this allows Flask to find the location and root path of the application's resources, such as templates and static files.
# __name__ is the name of the current Python module. The app needs to know where it's located to set up some paths, and __name__ is a convenient way to tell it that.
# you can also use the specific name of the file, but using __name__ is better because it's more reliable and just points to whatever module is currently being used as the entry point (so it won't break if you change the file name).
# The app variable is an instance of Flask, so you can use it like any other Python object. The Flask class has a constructor that takes the name of the current module (__name__) as argument.

CORS(app) # use the CORS class to pass in the app variable, this allows cross origin resource sharing which allows for use of your api by other domains

# To test the endpoints, you can use Postman, a popular tool for testing REST APIs. You can also use curl, a command line tool for making HTTP requests.

# To test the GET /products endpoint, you can use the following curl command: curl http://localhost:5070/products
# To test the GET /products/<id> endpoint, you can use the following curl command: curl http://localhost:5070/products/143
# To test the POST /products endpoint, you can use the following curl command: 
    # curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pencil", "price": 1.99}' http://localhost:5070/products (x = specify the request method, H = specify the request header, d = specify the request body)
# To test the PUT /products/<id> endpoint, you can use the following curl command:
    # curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pencil", "price": 1.99}' http://localhost:5070/products/143 (x = specify the request method, H = specify the request header, d = specify the request body)
# To test the DELETE /products/<id> endpoint, you can use the following curl command: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5070/products/143 (x = specify the request method)


"""

While the GET endpoints are easy to test with curl using a command line interface, the POST, PUT and DELETE commands can be cumbersome. 
To circumvent this problem, you can use Postman, which is a software that is available as a service.

Postman is a software that allows you to test your APIs. It is available as a service, and also as a desktop application. 
You can download the desktop application from https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.
